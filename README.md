## Assignment History


### Assignment Requirements
Use Terminal, Git and Github to create the project structure and a linked repository. Create a minimum of 6 SVG icons in Illustrator. Use
CSS to organize the icons on an HTML page (products)in your FIP. You can choose how you want to implement this - as an image tag
source, as an SVG tag, or using the object tag.

Use CSS interactions or transitions to change the icon’s appearance (on hover, as an example, reverse all of the colours or add a drop
shadow, etc). When clicked log a message to the console with the ID of the element that you’ve clicked. The ID should be retrieved and
displayed with a JavaScript string template and variable (refer to the class example).

Push the finished files to your repo; include a readme that describes the project. Merge everything to the main branch and submit a link to the dropbox on FOL - a .txt file is fine.
